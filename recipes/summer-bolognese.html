    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Think of this weeknight-friendly pasta recipe as a lighter take on the classic Italian ragù that features cherry tomatoes, a red chile for some heat, and tons of fresh basil.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>8 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 lb. ground chicken or turkey</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. tomato paste</li>
        <li>3 pints cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 red chile, such as Holland or Fresno, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>12 oz. bucatini, spaghetti, or rigatoni</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>2 oz. finely grated Parmesan (about 1 cup), plus more for serving</li>
        <li>2 cups basil leaves, torn if large</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium until shimmering. Cook garlic, stirring occasionally, until softened and fragrant but not browned, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add chicken, season with salt, and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until there are only a few pink spots left, 5–7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add wine and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, smashing down on chicken with a wooden spoon, until wine is evaporated and meat is finely ground, 4–6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add tomato paste and cook, stirring occasionally and still pressing down on meat, until tomato paste is slightly darkened, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes and chile and cook, stirring to coat, until tomatoes begin to burst, about 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Smash some but not all of the tomatoes with the back of wooden spoon to help create a sauce, then continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened and about half of tomatoes are completely broken down, 4–6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until very al dente, about 2 minutes less than package directions.</li>
        <li>Using tongs, transfer pasta to pot with sauce. Add butter, 2 oz. Parmesan, and ½ cup pasta cooking liquid. Cook over medium heat, tossing constantly, until pasta is al dente and liquid is slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from from heat and fold in basil until fragrant and leaves are slightly wilted.</li>
        <li>Transfer pasta to a platter. Top with more Parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
