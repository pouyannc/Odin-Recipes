    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Both guanciale and Pecorino are quite salty; Leonardo Vignoli, the chef at Da Cesare al Casaletto, recommends undersalting the pasta water to give you more control.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>6 ounces guanciale (salt-cured pork jowl), cut into ¾-inch pieces</li>
        <li>8 ounces rigatoni</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper, preferably ground with a mortar and pestle</li>
        <li>3 ounces Pecorino Romano, finely grated on the small holes of a box grater (about 3 cups)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-low. Cook guanciale, stirring often, until it starts to brown and crisp, 10–15 minutes; it will shrink dramatically as the fat renders. Transfer to a small bowl with a slotted spoon; reserve skillet (do not wipe out).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling lightly salted water, stirring occasionally, until pasta is about halfway cooked (not quite al dente); drain, reserving 1 ½ cups pasta cooking liquid.</li>
        <li>Add ¾ cup pasta cooking liquid to reserved skillet and bring to a gentle boil over medium heat, swirling often to encourage drippings and liquid to emulsify, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add pasta and cook, tossing often and adding more pasta cooking liquid as needed, until pasta is al dente and a thick, glossy sauce forms, 5–7 minutes (this second cooking is why you undercook the pasta initially).</li>
        <li>Increase heat to medium-high. Add guanciale, pepper, and two-thirds of Pecorino; toss well to combine and melt cheese. Serve pasta topped with remaining Pecorino.</li>
    </ol>
