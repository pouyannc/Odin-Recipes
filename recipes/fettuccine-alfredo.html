    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A fettuccine Alfredo recipe should never include cream; the silky sauce comes from an emulsion of grated Parmesan, melted butter, and starchy pasta water.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces fettuccine or other long pasta</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup (½ stick) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>¾ cup finely grated Parmesan, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until very al dente.</li>
        <li>Drain, reserving 2 cups pasta cooking liquid.</li>
        <li>Transfer 1 cup pasta cooking liquid to a large skillet.</li>
        <li>Bring to a gentle simmer, then whisk in butter, no more than 1 tablespoon at a time, until melted.</li>
        <li>Whisking constantly, gradually add cheese, making sure it’s completely melted and incorporated before adding more.</li>
        <li>Add pasta and toss to coat, adding more pasta cooking liquid as needed, until sauce blankets noodles completely.</li>
        <li>Serve topped with pepper and more cheese.</li>
    </ol>
